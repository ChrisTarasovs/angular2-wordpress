# Angular 2 + WordPress 

Angular 2 app + WordPress theme. 

## Usage

First, run `npm install`.

For development, simply run `ng serve`, in the terminal inside the project folder, and the CLI will do the rest. The content of the site is managed from the WordPress admin panel.  

To push the project to the server, run `ng build --prod --deploy-url="/wp-content/themes/{THEME_DIRECTORY_NAME}/dist/"` from your command line. This will output a `dist` folder. Upload index.php, styles.css, functions.php, and the dist folder to your theme directory on your server. You should be good to go!

This project will play nice with the Angular CLI.
